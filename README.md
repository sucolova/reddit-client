# reddit-client
A minimalistic way to browse reddit in the browser

# testing branch online:
https://jazzy-strudel-1ae5a3.netlify.app/

# limitations of the reddit.json api:
- no video sound
- no login option, thus no up/downvote functionality

# todo:

- up/downvote ratio bar
- handle rejected fetching
- styling
    - loading animations
    - responsive Design for all screen sizes
    - fallbacks for img, fonts etc.
    - toggle button dark and light mode
- disable video controls (audio source is not includet in reddit.json api)
- accessibility improvement
- say no comments when there are no comments
- on ipad when comments are visible -> overflow ( i guess because of screen rotation)
